For this project I decided to do something a little different. For example, instead of downloading and showing the icon, the app renders an animated scene to match the weather data. Everything from the sky, sun/moon position, cloud color/amount, rain amount and more. Next instead of have just 3 options for location I added a map where you can click anywhere to get the weather for that location. 
I understand this is a little different for the directions but I really wanted to showcase more of my creative side as well as a little more complex app. The downside to this is that I didn't have any time to refactor the code but I think it turned out pretty nice.

Hope you enjoy,

Andrew
